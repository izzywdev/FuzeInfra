"""Executable invariants for the secret-provision request filter.

secret-provision is the only path by which an agent session can cause a write to
this repo's Actions secrets, so its guard carries two properties that are easy to
conflate and must both hold:

  1. no caller may transport a secret VALUE into the workflow, and
  2. no caller may target a credential the platform depends on.

(1) is the one that bites. This repo's job logs are PUBLIC — the same fact that
forces cluster-query to refuse `kubectl get secret` — so a value accepted as a
`workflow_dispatch` input or a `client_payload` field is a published credential
the moment anyone dispatches it. The defence is structural rather than a filter:
the workflow declares no such input at all, and `test_no_input_transports_a_value`
fails the build if one is ever added. A reviewer adding `value:` to make the
workflow "more useful" is exactly the regression this file exists to stop.

(2) is why PROTECTED exists. `SECRETS_ADMIN_PAT` is the workflow's OWN credential:
letting a run rewrite it either locks the workflow out of the repo or silently
swaps the identity that every subsequent run acts as. `copy_from` is guarded for
the same reason even though a copy never prints anything — re-keying a privileged
credential under a caller-chosen name is a lateral move, not a read.

These tests EXECUTE the workflow's real bash guard rather than grepping it for
keywords. A guard asserted by substring passes just as happily when the shell
logic around it is broken, and the subtle cases here — a lowercase name, a
leading digit, `copy_from` equal to the target — are precisely the ones a
keyword check cannot distinguish.

Offline: parses one YAML file and runs bash. No network, no GitHub, no cluster.
