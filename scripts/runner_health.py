"""Detect ARC runners that are RUNNING but not actually serving jobs.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-23 the whole fleet's CI stopped (FuzeInfra#1187) and every
signal an operator would normally look at said the cluster was fine:

    $ kubectl -n arc-runners get pods
    fuzeplan-bhn6d-runner-976qb   2/2   Running   0   64m

Eighteen of nineteen runner pods looked exactly like that -- Ready, no restarts, no
events -- while GitHub reported every one of them `offline` and ~275 jobs queued. The
pods could not resolve DNS, so they never completed registration; `2/2 Running` only
means the containers started, never that the runner is reachable by GitHub.

That gap is the whole point of this module. `Running` is a local fact, `online` is a
remote one, and the outage lived precisely in the space between them. Nothing watched
that space, which is why this went unnoticed until someone chased a failing PR into it.

TWO DESIGN CHOICES WORTH KEEPING.

1. The scale-set -> repo mapping is read from the CLUSTER, from each
   AutoscalingRunnerSet's own `spec.githubConfigUrl`, never from a hardcoded fleet
   list. A hardcoded list silently stops covering a repo the day someone adds one, and
   a monitor with a blind spot is worse than no monitor because it reports green.

2. Findings name the NODES the offline pods sit on. In #1187 the diagnosis turned
   entirely on noticing that every offline runner was on `fuzeinfra-ci-runner-1/-2`
   while the one online runner was on an elastic node. That correlation took a while
   to spot by hand; it costs nothing to print it.

This module is deliberately pure: it takes already-fetched JSON and returns findings, so
the interesting logic is testable offline with no cluster and no network.
