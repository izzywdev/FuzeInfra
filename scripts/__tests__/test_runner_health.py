"""Executable invariants for scripts/runner_health.py.

The monitor's whole value is catching the case where local state and GitHub's view
disagree -- pods `2/2 Running`, GitHub `offline`. So the tests that matter here are the
ones that pin the disagreement, plus the two ways a monitor like this fails in practice:

  * crying wolf during normal scale-up (a pod that is 3 seconds old has not failed to
    register, it simply has not registered yet), and
  * reporting green for a scale set it silently does not cover.

The last test replays the real numbers from FuzeInfra#1187 to show the probe would have
fired on the outage it was written for.

Offline: pure functions over literals. No cluster, no network.
