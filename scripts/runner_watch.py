"""runner_watch — decide WHICH runner each fleet repo's jobs should use, PRECOMPUTE that
decision on a cron, publish it as a repo variable, and recover the runs that a wrong
decision already stranded.

===========================================================================================
WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL  (inherited verbatim in substance from the closed PR FuzeSDLC#249,
whose reasoning about WHAT to decide is unchanged here — only WHERE the decision runs)
===========================================================================================

`runs-on` is fixed at job dispatch. GitHub has no "this has queued too long, try somewhere
else" — a job pointed at a scale set that is down does not fail, it QUEUES FOREVER, and a
required context that never reports blocks merges with no red to look at
(governance/required-checks.json, invariant C3; governance/ci-runners.md, "the hazard that
makes the default matter").

The only place that decision can be made is BEFORE dispatch.

===========================================================================================
WHY THE SHAPE CHANGED FROM #249
===========================================================================================

#249 made that decision as a REUSABLE WORKFLOW, consumed by every workflow via
`uses:` + `needs:`. That works, and its decision logic was right, but the delivery shape
had two defects that no amount of care inside the workflow could fix:

  (a) It adds a JOB to every workflow run in the fleet. A chooser is overhead paid on
      every push, every PR, every re-run, forever — to answer a question whose answer
      changes maybe once a week.

  (b) It CANNOT RESOLVE for a public consumer of a private hub. A private repo's reusable
      workflow is not readable from a public repo's workflow run (FuzeInfra#758), so the
      five public repos in this fleet — FuzeFront, FuzeAgent, FuzeKeys, FuzeInfra, FuzeX —
      could never have consumed it. FuzeSDLC#261 INLINED two reusable workflows for exactly
      this reason; adding a third reusable workflow would have walked straight back into it.

Both defects are properties of "resolve the answer at dispatch time". Both disappear if the
answer is PRECOMPUTED and left somewhere every workflow can already read with no resolution
step at all — a repo variable:

    runs-on: ${{ vars.CI_RUNNER_LABELS || 'ubuntu-latest' }}

Zero extra jobs, no cross-repo workflow resolution, and a literal hosted default that keeps
governance/required-checks.md §2.2's "can never queue forever" property (see §2.2's
"precomputed variable" paragraph, and `runner_finding()` in scripts/gate_required_checks.py,
which already treats a hosted-defaulted expression as fit — invariant C3 is NOT weakened by
this pattern, it is satisfied by it).

===========================================================================================
WHAT PRECOMPUTING COSTS, AND WHAT THIS MODULE OWES BECAUSE OF IT
===========================================================================================

#249 could write, in its own comments, "there is no persisted state and no re-decision
inside a run ... that is what makes an oscillation impossible — there is no feedback loop
to oscillate." That guarantee was a FREE consequence of deciding per-run and writing
nothing.

This module writes. So the guarantee is no longer free, and buying it back is this module's
responsibility, discharged in three places:

  1. HYSTERESIS (`hysteresis()`): a newly-computed value is written only when it differs
     from the current one AND the SAME new value has been observed on N consecutive runs
     (default 2). A pool that flaps online/offline between two cron ticks therefore moves
     nobody. Without this, one transient blip rewrites the runner of every repo in the
     fleet, and the next tick rewrites them all back.

  2. FAIL-SAFE ON AN UNVERIFIABLE PROBE (`decide_runner()`, `online_runners is None`):
     when liveness cannot be established the decision is `None` — meaning KEEP THE CURRENT
     VALUE and warn loudly. This is where the precomputed form legitimately DIVERGES from
     #249's per-run form, and the divergence is deliberate:
       * #249 chose `ubuntu-latest` on a failed probe, because its output was consumed by
         exactly one run. Choosing hosted for one run is cheap and safe.
       * Here the output PERSISTS. Writing `ubuntu-latest` on a transient API blip would
         migrate the entire fleet off its runners on the strength of a 500, and would then
         need two more clean ticks to migrate back. "Do not invent an answer" is therefore
         the same fail-safe VALUE (never assume a pool is up) expressed correctly for a
         persistent sink: change nothing, and say so.

  3. RERUN CAP (`stranded_runs()` + the `recovered` state): a run is recovered AT MOST
     ONCE, ever. Without that cap, a run that is broken for a reason recovery cannot fix —
     a genuinely bad workflow file, a missing secret — gets cancelled, re-dispatched,
     queues again, and is cancelled again on the next tick, forever.

===========================================================================================
JOB B: WHY CANCEL+RERUN IS THE ONLY RECOVERY THAT EXISTS
===========================================================================================

`runs-on` is IMMUTABLE after dispatch, and there is no API to move a queued job to another
runner. Fixing the VARIABLE therefore does nothing for the runs already stranded behind the
old value — they keep queueing against a pool that is down, which is precisely the state
(a required check stuck at "Expected — waiting for status to be reported") that this whole
line of work exists to end.

So recovery is `gh run cancel` followed by `gh run rerun`: the re-dispatch reads
`vars.CI_RUNNER_LABELS` afresh and lands on the runner the watcher just chose.

That is a destructive operation, so its selector is written to be conservative in every
direction it can be:

  * ONLY jobs whose status is `queued` with NO runner assigned. A job with a runner is
    being served; it is slow, not stranded.
  * NEVER a run that has ANY job `in_progress`. Cancellation is per-RUN, not per-job, so
    cancelling a run to rescue its queued job would discard the real work its sibling job
    is doing. The selector therefore excludes the whole run — a strictly stronger guarantee
    than "do not select an in_progress job", and the honest one given the API's granularity.
  * only after a threshold (default 20 minutes) of queueing, so an ordinary busy-pool wait
    is never mistaken for a stranding.
  * at most once per run id, ever (see 3 above).
  * every action logged with the run URL and the reason, so the sweep is auditable after
    the fact rather than only while it is happening.

===========================================================================================
WHERE THIS RUNS  (the instance moved to FuzeInfra; the reasoning above did not change)
===========================================================================================

This file was authored in FuzeSDLC (PR #269) and the RUNNABLE INSTANCE was moved to
FuzeInfra before it ever ran on a schedule. One fact forced it:

    FuzeSDLC is PRIVATE, so its GitHub-hosted minutes are METERED. A hosted job in a
    private repo whose account budget is gone does not fail, it NEVER STARTS:
    `runner_id: 0`, zero steps, no log, "The job was not started because an Actions
    budget is preventing further use".

Every job of this watcher is hardcoded `ubuntu-latest` on purpose (a chooser that runs on
the pool it evaluates cannot report that pool down), so the watcher is hosted-only by
design — and BUDGET EXHAUSTION IS ONE OF THE TWO CONDITIONS IT EXISTS TO DETECT. A
hosted-only watcher in a metered repo therefore has an availability dependency CORRELATED
WITH THE FAILURE IT DETECTS: the budget running out both raises the alarm and silences it.
FuzeInfra is PUBLIC, where Actions is free and unmetered, so the same hosted-only design
has no billing dependency at all; it is also the infra repo, which makes fleet runner
health its natural domain.

    gh api repos/izzywdev/FuzeSDLC --jq .private   => true
    gh api repos/izzywdev/FuzeInfra --jq .private   => false

MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED (2026-09-01). The move was prompted by a report that FuzeSDLC's
budget was exhausted and its hosted jobs were failing instantly. That symptom is NOT
present as of the port — FuzeSDLC's `ubuntu-latest` jobs currently succeed with real
runner ids and full step lists. The structural argument does not depend on it (metered vs
free is a property of the repo, not of this week's balance), so the move stands; the
framing is corrected here rather than repeated. The OTHER detected condition, meanwhile,
IS live in the authoring repo right now: PR #269's own CI has 15+ jobs `queued` 32-38
minutes with `runner_id: 0` against `fuze-runner` — precisely what `stranded_runs()`
selects, and precisely the never-reporting required check this design exists to end.

Three consequences, all of them mechanical rather than design changes:

  1. THE HUB IS FuzeInfra. `--hub` defaults to `izzywdev/FuzeInfra`, and the two durable
     state variables (STATE_VAR_DECIDE / STATE_VAR_RECOVER) live on FuzeInfra.

  2. THE FLEET LIST IS STILL FuzeSDLC'S. governance/ruleset-fleet.json stays in the hub of
     record, where ruleset_sync / repo_settings_sync / prune_merged_branches read it; it is
     NOT copied here, because a second copy is a second thing to forget and this module's
     whole claim is that a repo joining the fleet joins the watcher with no second list.
     runner-watch.yml fetches it with the same App token and passes `--fleet-file`, and
     fails loudly if it cannot. `fleet_repos()` itself is unchanged and still a pure read.

  3. THE GOVERNANCE STANDARDS DID NOT MOVE. governance/required-checks.md §2.2.1 and
     governance/ci-runners.md — cited throughout this file — remain FuzeSDLC's. Those are
     the standard; this is the instance that implements it. Section references here point
     at FuzeSDLC's copies.

FuzeInfra is `excluded` in ruleset-fleet.json, so the hub is not in its own fleet: the
watcher never writes its own CI_RUNNER_LABELS. That was already true before the move and
is the correct shape either way.

===========================================================================================
OUT OF SCOPE HERE (stage 2)
===========================================================================================

BUDGET AWARENESS. #249's precedence order had a budget arm; this stage deliberately has
none, and the fleet's private repos therefore keep routing to their pool whenever it is up,
regardless of Actions spend. Note that the account budget being exhausted is a LIVE
condition, not a hypothetical — it is what moved this watcher to FuzeInfra (see "WHERE THIS
RUNS") — so stage 2 has a real customer. Before it is written, the billing endpoint MUST be
re-verified: `GET /users/{owner}/settings/billing/actions` currently returns

    410 This endpoint has been moved

so any stage-2 design that assumes it is a live source of `included_minutes` /
`total_minutes_used` is starting from a fact that is no longer true. Find the replacement
endpoint (or accept that budget cannot be read at all and design around that) FIRST.

===========================================================================================
OFFLINE-TESTABILITY CONTRACT
===========================================================================================

Every decision in this file is a pure function over plain data — `decide_runner`,
`hysteresis`, `stranded_runs`, `load_state`, `dump_state`. The network lives only in the
thin `_gh*` helpers and in `main()`. scripts/__tests__/test_runner_watch.py drives the pure
functions with no token, no network and no cluster, the same discipline
scripts/prune_merged_branches.py holds for its own delete decision.

                               it is a non-option.
      2. operator pin        — governance/runner-watch.json. A human said "leave this one
                               alone"; the watcher reports and writes nothing.
      3. public repo         — Actions is free and unmetered; spending scarce self-hosted
                               capacity here costs a shared resource to save nothing.
      4. no declared pool    — hosted is the documented default (ci-runners.md).
      5. probe unverified    — KEEP CURRENT + warn. See the module docstring, point 2.
      6. 0 online            — hosted, because queue-forever is the worse failure: a human
                               can top up GitHub in minutes, whereas repairing the cluster
                               REQUIRES working CI. Never route onto a pool observed down.
      7. otherwise           — the declared pool (private repos conserve metered minutes).

    Note the ONE arm of #249 that could not survive the shape change: its step 1 was
    "explicit override via vars.CI_RUNNER_LABELS". That variable is now this watcher's OWN
    output, so honouring it as an override would make the watcher permanently defer to its
    own last write and never change anything again. The operator lever moved to
    governance/runner-watch.json's `pinned`, which is a separate sink and therefore still
    an override rather than a feedback loop.

#   * Two, because Job A and Job B write independently; a single blob would let whichever
#     job finished second clobber the other's update.
#   * Variables rather than an Actions cache because a cache entry is evicted after 7 days
#     without a read and is scoped to the branch that wrote it. A weekly-ish signal stored
#     in a cache would silently reset itself, and a reset hysteresis counter is
