# Provision the ONE read-only FuzeSDLC deploy key and distribute it EVERYWHERE IT IS NEEDED.
#
# ⚠️  RUN THIS YOURSELF — it modifies access controls (registers a deploy key on FuzeSDLC) and
#     writes repo secrets. It is intentionally NOT run by automation.
#
# Trust model (min-privilege, max-decoupling): a SINGLE read-only deploy key grants read to
# izzywdev/FuzeSDLC ONLY. Its private half is distributed as the `FUZESDLC_DEPLOY_KEY` secret
# to each consuming repo, whose governance-sync.yml uses it to fetch the FuzeSDLC canonical.
# No repo ever gets write to another; each repo reconciles with its OWN GITHUB_TOKEN + this
# shared read key. FuzeSDLC never needs write to any consumer (no fan-out, no hub-held key
# that could read every repo).
#
# "Everywhere needed" is COMPUTED, not hardcoded: the targets are exactly the repos that have
# `.github/workflows/governance-sync.yml` on their default branch. Onboard a new repo with
# sdlc-bootstrap.sh, re-run this, and it picks the repo up. No list to drift.
#
# NOTE: you do NOT need FuzeSDLC's Actions "Access" setting for this. The stamped
# governance-sync workflow is deliberately SELF-CONTAINED (it fetches the canonical with this
# key rather than `uses:`-ing a cross-repo reusable workflow, which cannot resolve against a
# private FuzeSDLC and would red every PR). Earlier revisions of this script said otherwise —
# that instruction was obsolete.
#
# Idempotent: an existing key is reused (never silently rotated); an already-set secret is
# reported and skipped unless --force.
#
# Prereqs: `gh` authenticated as an owner/admin of izzywdev/FuzeSDLC and the targets;
# `ssh-keygen` available.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/setup-fuzesdlc-deploy-key.sh                 # auto-discover + provision + verify
#   scripts/setup-fuzesdlc-deploy-key.sh --dry-run       # show what it WOULD do, touch nothing
#   scripts/setup-fuzesdlc-deploy-key.sh izzywdev/FuzeX  # restrict to explicit repos

   Watch the first few runs: this is the moment the fleet begins enforcing policy.

   Min-privilege check (worth doing once): the key reads $SDLC_REPO ONLY — it cannot write,
   and cannot read any other repo.

   Still needed for the expert-publish path (a SEPARATE credential, not this one):
   FUZESDLC_AGENT_PUSH_TOKEN — a fine-grained PAT scoped to $SDLC_REPO only, Contents +
   Pull requests = read/write. GitHub has NO API to mint a PAT, so it is browser-only:
   https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
