"""Delete DUPLICATE Cloudflare Access App Launcher tiles.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
FuzeInfra owns the App Launcher. Every tile is a `type = "bookmark"` Access
application declared in `local.launcher_services` (cloudflare.tf) — a pure link
carrying a `logo_url`, with authentication supplied by the single wildcard
self-hosted app on `*.prod.fuzefront.com`.

Consumer repos do not have that context. Twice now a consumer created its OWN
`type = "self_hosted"` Access application for a host FuzeInfra already publishes
a tile for, with `app_launcher_visible: true`, out-of-band via the Cloudflare
API — see izzywdev/FuzeFront `docs/runbooks/unleash-launcher-and-developer-flags.md`,
which records creating app `514f8a21-3793-4726-858e-819556fbe346` for
`unleash.prod.fuzefront.com`. The result is TWO tiles for one service: the
Terraform bookmark (correct logo) and the consumer's self-hosted app (no
`logo_url`, so the launcher renders a blank/generic icon).

Terraform alone cannot fix this. The duplicates are not in state, and a resource
that does not exist in configuration cannot be destroyed — importing each one by
hand needs an app id nobody has until they look. So this reconciler runs at apply
time and deletes, by discovery, any launcher-visible Access application for a
host FuzeInfra already owns a tile for.

WHAT IT WILL NOT TOUCH — the safety envelope, in order:
  1. Anything Terraform owns (MANAGED_APP_IDS is every Access application id in
     this root module) — so the bookmarks themselves can never be pruned.
  2. Anything in KEEP_APP_IDS (var.launcher_tile_prune_keep_ids), the operator
     escape hatch for a deliberate per-host self-hosted app.
  3. Apps that are not launcher-visible. An invisible app carries policy but no
     tile, so it is not a duplicate of anything and deleting it would change
     access, not appearance.
  4. Account-level app types that are not per-host tiles: app_launcher, warp,
     biso, dash_sso.
  5. Any host outside LAUNCHER_HOSTS — the exact `<key>.prod.fuzefront.com` set
     derived from `local.launcher_services`. Nothing else in the account is even
     considered.

EFFECT ON ACCESS when a duplicate IS deleted: the host falls back to the
wildcard `*.prod.fuzefront.com` email-OTP app that already covered it before the
consumer's app existed. FuzeFront's runbook states its policy was written to
mirror that wildcard's allowlist exactly, so effective access is unchanged — the
tile goes away, the gate does not.

Environment (all supplied by the null_resource in cloudflare.tf):
  CF_API_TOKEN     Cloudflare API token — needs Account > Access: Apps and
                   Policies > Edit (the same token that creates the bookmarks).
  CF_ACCOUNT_ID    Cloudflare account id.
  LAUNCHER_HOSTS   Comma-separated hostnames FuzeInfra publishes tiles for.
  MANAGED_APP_IDS  Comma-separated Terraform-owned Access application ids.
  KEEP_APP_IDS     Comma-separated ids to leave alone regardless.
  PRUNE_DRY_RUN    Set to 1 to report what would be deleted without deleting.
