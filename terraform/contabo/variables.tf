    regardless. The consumer's Ingress rule is the only gate on SERVING. Applying
    this on a zone that already has the record fails on a duplicate unless the

    At the DNS layer, reserved hosts need no exclusion list: explicit records and
    the *.<prod_subdomain> wildcard are more specific and win automatically. That
    does NOT extend to Traefik, which sorts routers by rule length — a consumer's
    wildcard Ingress rule will capture other products' exact hosts unless it is
    isolated in its own Ingress at router.priority 1.
