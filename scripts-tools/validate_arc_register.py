"""Authorize (or refuse) a dispatched arc-register request.

Used by .github/workflows/arc-register.yml to decide whether a consumer's
`repository_dispatch` (or an operator's `workflow_dispatch`) may install/
uninstall an ARC AutoscalingRunnerSet for a given repo.

WHY THIS DOES NOT JUST TRUST client_payload.repo:
repository_dispatch carries no field GitHub itself vouches for that names the
*sending* repo. The identity GitHub does attach (`github.actor` / the PAT
owner) is the human who minted the dispatch token, and every consumer repo's
FUZEINFRA_DISPATCH_TOKEN is minted by the same account — so that identity is
identical no matter which repo actually dispatched. The claimed `repo` string
in the payload is therefore just a claim, not a proof.

The mitigation: `repo` must be an EXACT key in config/arc-register-allowlist.json,
and once matched, every value actually used to register the runner (the GitHub
repo URL, the scale-set name) is read from THAT config entry -- never taken
verbatim from the payload. A forged or mistyped `repo` can, at worst, cause the
handler to act on a DIFFERENT already-allowlisted repo (a mapping visible and
diffable in this file's git history); it can never point a `helm upgrade
--install` at an arbitrary, non-allowlisted target. This is the same shape as
config/infra-request-whitelist.json + validate_infra_request.py, applied here
because arc-register's blast radius (which repo gets write access into the
shared arc-runners namespace) is exactly the kind of thing that whitelist
pattern exists to bound.

Two possible decisions:
  * "authorized" -> repo is an allowlist key AND action is install|uninstall.
  * "denied"      -> anything else. Fails closed: an unlisted repo, a missing
                     repo, or an unrecognized action is always denied.

Usage:
    validate_arc_register.py --allowlist config/arc-register-allowlist.json \
        --repo izzywdev/FuzeHub --action install [--github-output "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"]

Exit code is always 0 (the decision is conveyed via output, not process
failure) so the calling workflow step can branch on `decision` rather than
parse a crash. The workflow's own next step is responsible for turning
`decision=denied` into a failed job.

Writes to stdout and (if given) --github-output:
  decision=authorized|denied
  repo=<canonical allowlist key, only set when authorized>
  repo_url=https://github.com/<canonical allowlist key>
  scale_set_name=<from the allowlist entry, only set when authorized>
  action=install|uninstall
  reasons=<human-readable explanation>
